      <description>We are excited to announce that we have been invited to speak at DEFCON 31 this August! Now that we&amp;rsquo;re accepted, we need your help getting there!
We need to raise $5,000 over the next 6 weeks to bring all of our team members to the conference and to make all of the demos picture perfect.
Please consider buying us a coffee or becoming a monthly supporter. You&amp;rsquo;ll also get access to our private Discord Server by becoming a member.</description>

      <description>Today billions of people lead double lives. One, grounded in their physical existance. And another, contained within the harddrives of countless corporate clouds. Lifetime&amp;rsquo;s of content and metadata are being shoveled into networks hostile to free expression and privacy.
Your data is destined to be stored on servers you do not own. To be crunched and combed over for corporate gain, government survailence and exploited by cyber criminals for ill gotten profits.</description>
