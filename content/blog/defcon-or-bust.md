We are excited to announce that we have been invited to speak at DEFCON 31 this August! Now that we're accepted, we need your help getting there!

We need to raise [$5,000](https://ko-fi.com/dataparty/goal?g=0) over the next 6 weeks to bring all of our team members to the conference and to make all of the demos picture perfect.

Please consider [buying us a coffee or becoming a monthly supporter](https://ko-fi.com/dataparty). You'll also get access to our private Discord Server by becoming a member.


Attending DEFCON in person? You can find out about our talk schedule by [following the official DEFCON 31 forum discussion](https://forum.defcon.org/node/245770).
